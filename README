This public domain software package provides ANSI C source code written to
attempt to solve the RSA Labs RC5 Challenges.  The code for the 56bit DES
Challenge was omitted because the challenge has already been solved.

This code was written for two purposes.  First it was written to provide
a portable alternative to people who could not run the distributed.net 
clients because they could not trust closed source software on their 
systems.  Secondly, this code was written to be instructional.  It is 
written in clean and clear ANSI C to help people learn and understand
the mechanics of large scale partial known plaintext cryptographic attack.
For this reason, the cryptographic portion of the code is not written in
hand optimized processor specific assembly.

I hope that you will find this code interesting and inspiring.
